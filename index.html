        The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian territory anymore. You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or you had Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times Square in New York on the first International Yoga Day.
        <br>
        <br>

<strong>But, what's the significance?
</strong>
<br>
The Namaste, or namaskar, or 'namaskar' is one of the five forms of traditional greetings mentioned in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas. It translates to 'I bow to you', and greeting one another with it is a way of saying 'May our minds meet', indicated by the folded palms placed before the chest. The word Namaha can also be translated as 'na ma' (not mine), to signify the reductions of one's ego in the presence of the other.</p>

          India also sees a large number of festivals, mainly because of the prevalence of diverse religions and groups. The Muslims celebrate Eid, the Christians have Christmas and good Friday, the Sikhs have Baisakhi (harvesting of crop), and the birthdays of their Gurus and the Hindus have Diwali, Holi, Makar Sakranti, the Jains have Mahavir Jayanti, the Buddhists celebrate the Buddha's birthday on Buddha Poornima, and quite honestly, the number is endless. All of these translate to holidays in our book, of course.

        <br>
Also, in India, there exists the concept of a joint family, wherein the entire family (parents, wife, children and in some cases, relatives) all live together. This is mostly because of the cohesive nature of the Indian society, and also reportedly helps in handling pressure and stress.

<b><p style="font-size: 30px;"> ⚫ Fasting</p> </b>

          Fasting is an integral part of Hindu Culture. Fasts or Vrats or Upvas are a way to represent your sincerity and resolve, or express your gratitude to the Gods and Goddesses.  People throughout the country observe fasts during various religious occasions. Some people also observe fast on different days of a week in favour of a particular God or Goddess associated with that specific day. It is widely believed that by doing so, you are depriving your body of a basic necessity and thus, punishing yourself to cleanse off the sins that you have committed until the day of fast.

          The rules and regulations of a rapid are in accordance with the particular occasion. The origin of fast probably comes from the  Vedic ritual of kindling the sacrificial fire for sacrifice purposes. Since the word 'upvas' has been used for denoting both fasts and kindling sacrificial fire, it can be thought that people observed fasts when they had to kindle or rekindle the domestic fires kept in their homes to perform daily sacrifices. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 30px">
          Clothing in India is dependent upon the different ethnicities, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. Historically, male and female clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan, lungi, sari, well as rituals and dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a great diversity[1] in terms of weaves, fibers, colours, and material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India also encompasses the wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishment, styles of wearing clothes. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.</p>

  Indian literature can be traced back in the great epics written in the form of poems, plays, stories, and even self-help guides. The most famous Hindu epics are Ramayana and Mahabharata. Mahabharata, by Ved Vyasa, is the longest poem written in Sanskrit. Both these epics are written in order to highlight human values of sacrifice, loyalty, devotion and truth. The moral of both stories signify the triumph of good over evil.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 30px">India is home to quite a few unique styles of martial arts, some of which have ancient origins. While some martial art forms require the use of weaponry, some don't. Mainly used for combat, some martial art forms are also used for healing. In today's times, these martial art forms are popular as self-defence techniques and even fitness.</p>

    India is socially, culturally, and linguistically very diverse. Hindi and English are widely spoken and recognised for official purposes. Other than than, there are 22 scheduled languages recognised by the constitution of India. However, more than 400 languages and dialects in India are still not known. Dialects change even with a few kilometres of travel in the state. Over the years, about 190 languages have become endangered due to very few surviving speakers.
There exist thousands of traditions and culture in India, and quite a few of them would leave outsiders rather curious. But the crux of Indian society and culture has always been to be well mannered, polite, respect others, and progress together.

  ⚫ Dances of India</p></b>

  <p style="font-size: 30px">
    India is a land of 'unity in diversity', and our dances are no different. Different forms of dance(classified as folk or classical) find origin from different parts of the country, and they are a way of representation of the particular culture from which they originate. Eight classical dances, which are classified as Indian classical dances and find a mention in the Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natyashashtra', (a text of performing arts) are:
    <br>
    <br>
-Bharatnatyam from Tamil Nadu<br>
-Kathakali from Kerela<br>
-Kathak from North, West and Central India<br>
-Mohiniyattam from Kerela<br>
-Kuchipudi from Andhra Pradesh<br>
-Oddisi from Odhisa<br>
-Manipuri from Manipur<br>
-Sattriya from Assam<br>
<br>
All the dance mentioned above forms are a complete dance drama, wherein a dancer or performer narrates an entire story, almost entirely and exclusively through gestures. Such stories are mostly based on the vast Indian mythology. Classical dances in India are strictly classified as and performed according to the rules and guidelines prescribed in the Natyashastra. Just like Classical dances, folk dances in India too originate from different regions of the country. These performances are mostly based on stories which are orally passed on from one generation to the other.

Folk dances mainly trace their importance to the rural areas, where performances depict the day to day life of rural inhabitants. The process for a suitable match is one long and tiring effort, which begins with matching some criteria like the horoscope, religion, caste, professional stature, physical appearance and culture. It is made sure that majority of the requirements are a 'match made in heaven' (even if it has to be tailor-made). After all the checkboxes are ticked, the elders of the family meet for a face to face interaction. Once the talks are successful, preparations for the wedding begin in full swing.

  ⚫ cuisine Of Foods </p></b>

    Indian food and cuisine not only form an integral part of the culture of India but are also one of the critical factors of India's popularity worldwide. The style of cooking varies from region to region, though unanimously, Indian food has a significant reputation for its extensive use of spices and herbs. Just like dances, religious practices, language and clothes, you will also find a wide variety of food throughout the country. Almost every region is known for a signature dish or ingredient.

    The staple, however, throughout the nation consists mostly of rice, wheat and Bengal gram (Chana). While vegetarian food is an integral part of Gujrati South Indian and Rajasthani cuisines, non-vegetarian dishes form a central part of Mughlai, Bengali, North Indian and Punjabi cuisine. It is also interesting to note that specific cuisines like that of Kashmir have also been influenced by foreign cooking styles from Central Asia, Persia and Afghanistan.
